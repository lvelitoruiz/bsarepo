 - Image error: There was an image that was wrongly named 'icon.svg' the name was corrected to 'welding-icon.svg' in order to correct this problem.

 Navigation: 

 - Indicator numbers:

    - The font would not have to be seen on sizes over tablet, so I put a 'display: none' on them.
    - To show them on phones I used the breakpoint for minor to phone to change to 'display: block'.
    - The phone wasn't the one on the design, so I used the 'forza' font that was used for the phone numbers.
    - Changed the color of the font.
    - Changed the Margin right of the font.

 - Menu:

    - The menu title didn't changed to 'close' when toggled, added a line to the function to change the value of the boolean to force the change.

 - Images:
    - image main had the burn to the left, changed it to the right.
    - image top didn't have height and width, also didn't have styles, put it position, width, and height, also translate to positioning it better.
    - image bottom didn't have height and width, also didn't have styles, put it position, width, and height, also translate to positioning it better.
    - the after pseudoclass didn't have styles, put them to better emulate the image.
    - image main on responsive had to have the burn to the left, put it that way.
    - Theres some redimensioning on the images for responsive, done too.

 Openings: 

 - There was a bad closed strong, corrected.
 - Didn't had the black strip that is on the design, added using :before.
 - The colors on the decorations weren't accurate, corrected aswell.
 - Colors on decorations were different on mobile, corrected.

 Culture:

 - The side image was incorrectly positioned, corrected thepositioning.
 - Content didn't have a position attribute, changed to relative in order to better positioning the side image.
 - Padding wasn't declared for the responsive part of the content, corrected it.

 About:
